# What is SNMP?

- A standardised protocol used for monitoring and managing network devices like routers, switches, servers, and printers.
- Enables administrators to remotely collect information about device status, performance, and configuration.
- Works by allowing management systems to query devices for specific information using a request-response model.
- Consists of three key components: managers (monitoring stations), agents (software on managed devices), and the Management Information Base (MIB).
- Has evolved through versions v1, v2c, v3 with v3 adding important security features like strong authentication and encryption.

# Notes on SNMP security

- SNMP implementations below v3 are plain text only.
- The IETF released SNMPv1 in 1988. The IETF released SNMPv3 in 1998.
- Historically, the code quality of SNMP agent implementations has been a cause for concern.
- SNMPv3 configuration is complex and arcane. 
- Best practice is _still_ to ensure SNMP Agents are only presented on a dedicated management network.
- Vendors have been gradulary deprecating the management features of SNMP, often in favour of NETCONF/YANG, but maintaining SNMP for read-only metrics.

# Best practices regarding SNMP security

- Wherever supported use SNMPv3.
- Use dedicated read-only credentials.
- Keep all SNMP traffic within the originating security zone.

<!--
Openview used to be a market leader with strong integration with Dec, Compaq and HP hardware. Since the aquision by Micro Focus it has deminished in importance.<br>
Solarwinds has a reputaion of being expensive and complex to license as features are fine grained locked behind multiple, seperately licensed, modules. The security incident in 2020 is still a recent memory.<br>
Netcool (I used to work on it at Micromuse before they were borged^?^?^?^?^?^? aquired by IBM) is very much focused at carrier grade customers.
