# Done

## 2025-03-05
- Moved example configuration files to the examples directory
- Updated bootstrap_loader.py to look for example files in the examples directory
- Updated validate_config.py to support using example files with the -e flag
- Updated validate_runtime_config.py to support using example files with the -e flag
- Updated main.py to support using example configuration from the examples directory
- Updated README.md to reflect the new directory structure
- Removed transformation functionality from the runtime schema
- Updated validation scripts to use model_dump instead of dict for Pydantic v2 compatibility
- Removed index management configuration from the runtime schema to simplify the application
- Created test script for fetching metrics from SNMP exporter
- Tested configuration against real SNMP exporter with successful ECS mapping

## Bootstrap Configuration

- ✅ Defined bootstrap configuration schema in JSON format (`bootstrap_schema.json`)
- ✅ Created Pydantic models for bootstrap configuration (`bootstrap_schema.py`)
- ✅ Created example bootstrap configuration file (`examples/bootstrap_config_example.yaml`)
- ✅ Implemented bootstrap configuration loader with support for:
  - ✅ Loading from YAML/JSON files
  - ✅ Loading from environment variables
  - ✅ Merging configuration from multiple sources
- ✅ Added validation of bootstrap configuration against schema
- ✅ Created utility script for validating bootstrap configuration (`validate_config.py`)
- ✅ Created main application entry point (`main.py`)
- ✅ Added project dependencies to pyproject.toml
- ✅ Created project documentation (README.md)

## Runtime Configuration
- ✅ Defined runtime configuration schema using Pydantic (`runtime_schema.py`)
- ✅ Created JSON schema for runtime configuration (`runtime_schema.json`)
- ✅ Created example runtime configuration file (`examples/runtime_config_example.json`)
- ✅ Created utility script for validating runtime configuration (`validate_runtime_config.py`)
- ✅ Added support for multiple exporters and targets
- ✅ Added support for ECS mappings
- ❌ Removed support for metric transformations
- ❌ Removed support for index management configuration
- ✅ Created test script for fetching metrics from exporters (`test_snmp_fetch.py`)

## Project Organization
- ✅ Moved example configuration files to the examples directory
- ✅ Updated scripts to look for example files in the examples directory
- ✅ Updated README.md to reflect the new directory structure
- ✅ Created `examples` directory for all example/test configuration files
- ✅ Added `.gitignore` to examples directory

## Next Steps

The next phase of work will focus on connecting to Elasticsearch to retrieve the runtime configuration and implementing the metrics collection logic.
